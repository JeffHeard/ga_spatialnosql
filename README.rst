ga_spatialnosql - Spatial extensions for non-spatial NoSQL databases
####################################################################

Introduction
============

This is a set of extensions for adapting NoSQL databases with fast primary key
lookup to spatial databases with all the standard SQLMM types. Right now
MongoDB is supported.  Redis will be supported in the near future.  

This is a relocatable Django app.  It requires at a minimum pymongo and
pyspatialite (which requires Spatialite).
